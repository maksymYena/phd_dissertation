# PhD Dissertation - Readme

Welcome to the readme for my PhD dissertation project. This research explores the capabilities of drones in various scenarios and examines their performance under different conditions. The project is divided into two sub-projects, each addressing specific aspects of drone functionality and application.

## Sub-Project 1: Drone Trajectories Analysis

In this sub-project, we focus on understanding the trajectories of drones and their behavior in different scenarios. We also investigate the influence of weather conditions on their flying abilities.
